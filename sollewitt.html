<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt">Sol LeWitt</a> was an American conceptual artist known for his large scale geometric wall drawings. I saw his work this spring at the National Museum of Art in Washington D.C. and thought is would be fun to make another little HTML5 Canvas visualization that mirrors his work. Enjoy!</p>
